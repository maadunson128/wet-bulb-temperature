## Project Overview
This project explores the concept of Wet Bulb Temperatureâ€”a crucial measure that combines heat and humidity to understand the potential impact on human health, especially in the context of rising global temperatures.

## Features
1. **Weather Information**: Provides real-time weather data for cities using the OpenWeather API.
2. **Wet Bulb Temperature Calculator**: Calculates the Wet Bulb Temperature based on user-inputted temperature and relative humidity.
3. **Historical Data Visualization**: Visualizes historical Wet Bulb Temperature data for coastal areas.
